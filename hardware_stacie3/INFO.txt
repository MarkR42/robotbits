Flip coupler and wheels - can be PLA.

Could use the ngen for wheels?!


MAKING wheel_gear
----------------

Wheels should be printed without any adhesion or support material 
as it is difficult to remove.


MAKING wheel_gear_bearing
----------------

This has an overhang / bridging. The cutouts for bearings (8x4x3).

3mm hole needs to be drilled out, this could be done after bearings 
are installed.
