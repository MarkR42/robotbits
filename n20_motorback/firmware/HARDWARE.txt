HARDWARE used in the n20 motorback ESC microcontroller

IO PORTS:

0,1 = Outputs to drive H-Bridge driver chip inputs.

Low,Low = hi-z, everything off
High,Low = Drive in direction
High,High = Braking active

2 = LED, active high

3 = PWM input, also the reset pin.
    To activate it we must enable the RSTDISBL flag in the configuration byte 0

CLOCK:
Use the internal 8mhz clock generator.
Divide by 2 using the clock prescaler.
System clock should be 4mhz
    
TIMER:

Use divide-by-8 function.
So it should tick every 2 microseconds.

Timer is in 10bit mode, counts up to 512 then wraps.

This generates PWM and is also used to measure input pulse widths.



timer 512 * 2 microseconds

blink cycle (idle mode) 
64 ms?
