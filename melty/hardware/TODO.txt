1. PCB electronics: Build controlboard power supply 
    and test that the 3.3v is ok
    
1. PCB electronics: Mount the esp32-pico-d4 and antenna - spin that up and get it
    working.
        - Need to get soicbite thing for it.
    
1. Design and build wheel of correct dimensions - diameter at least
    18mm, maybe 20mm,
    over the 15mm can of the motor.
  
    - Maybe 3d printed
    - Either put on silicone tyres, OR
    - superglue bits of old rubber gloves, neatly

1. Make a power distribution board, with veroboard.
    - Switch.
    - space to connect ESCs and controlboard.
    
1. Make harness to connect 2x lipo

1. Figure out how to fit all the gubbins into the shell
    - the control board needs to sit vertically, ideally.
    - the ESCs can be any way.
