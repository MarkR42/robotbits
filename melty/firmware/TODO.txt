TODO things


1. In motors module, initialise esc telemetry uart
    - Use a GPIO pin which we can access on dev board.
    DONE
    
1. Get esc telemetry received 
    decipher esc telemetry.
    PARTIALLY done
    
1. Motors module should check telemetry is working during initialisation,
    on both ESCs.
    
We can do motor initialisation in parallel, there are some
delays necessary to wait for the ESCs to startup in the case of power
on.

Also disarm the ESC by waiting some time (1 sec?) with no commands
    sent, there is no other way to disarm that I know
    
1. Try higher speed DSHOT, maybe 600 khz
