TODO things


1. In motors module, initialise esc telemetry uart
    - Use a GPIO pin which we can access on dev board.
    DONE
    
1. Get esc telemetry received 
    decipher esc telemetry.
    PARTIALLY done
    
1. Motors module should check telemetry is working during initialisation,
    on both ESCs.
    
We can do motor initialisation in parallel, there are some
delays necessary to wait for the ESCs to startup in the case of power
on.

Also disarm the ESC by waiting some time (1 sec?) with no commands
    sent, there is no other way to disarm that I know
    
1. Try higher speed DSHOT, maybe 600 khz

ERPM:
-----

Motors have 12 magnets. These are in pairs (N/S)
ERPM is the number of commutations per minute, for all phases, so
we need to divide by half the number of poles,

SO RPM = ERPM / 6

At throttle 50, ERPM = 10000 RPM = 1666
At throttle 100, ERPM = 16000 RPM = 2666
Throttle 200 ERPM = 31500
Throttle 400 ERPM = 62000
Throttle 500 ERPM = 76000 RPM = 12666
Throttle 1000 ERPM = 150000 RPM = 25k
