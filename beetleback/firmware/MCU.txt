The ATTINY13A microcontroller.

It is very minimal !

5 generally usable GPIOs - one reset pin

1k of Flash for program memory
64bytes ram
Some more flash for eeprom (settings, fuses etc)

NOTES:
------

1. Flash memory is not in the memory map for normal instructions;
    there is no pointer which points at flash.

    So any data which needs to have a pointer - including char *
    - need to be copied to ram at startup by init code generated
    from the compiler.
    
    Program memory can be read by special instructions, use 
    pgm_read_byte etc, from avr/pgmspace.h
    
1. There is only one timer. It does not need to be explicitly
    enabled as it's always active. It can be temporarily disabled, reset and
    change some parameters including clock-divider.
    
1. Some peripherals - clock generator, brownout detector - cannot
    be configured programmatically, only by programming fuses.
    
    There are two bytes of fuses, some of them can brick the
    device so be careful.
