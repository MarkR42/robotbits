PB0 - MOTOR_PWM_1
PB1 - MOTOR_PWM_2
PB2 - PWMIN
PB3 - ~FAULT
PB4 - Led (active high)
PB5 - reset (NC)

We can use the hardware PWM generator from the timer
to pulse PB0 or PB1.

Then in the main loop, we can just loop checking PWMIN and timer


Timer is only 8-bit so need to set the divider to a reasonable time,
then as it overflows, we increment a global variable to store the time
since startup.

The time since startup is important as we need to remember when the
last pulse was, too long between pulses = failsafe, turn off motor.

We also need to measure the pulse width accurately.
